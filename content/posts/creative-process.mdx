Every masterpiece starts with a blank page. But what happens between that first mark and the final product? The creative process is less about inspiration and more about iteration.

## The Myth of the Muse

We romanticize creativity as lightning striking—sudden, unpredictable, magical. The reality is far more **systematic**. Great creators aren't waiting for inspiration; they're showing up every day.

### The Four Stages

1. **Preparation:** Immerse yourself in the problem
2. **Incubation:** Let your subconscious work on it
3. **Illumination:** The "aha!" moment arrives
4. **Verification:** Test, refine, and polish

Creativity isn't a gift—it's a practice. And like any practice, it responds to dedication.
