The fashion industry is one of the world's largest polluters. But a new generation of designers and consumers is proving that style and sustainability aren't mutually exclusive.

## The True Cost of Fast Fashion

That $5 t-shirt has a hidden price. Water pollution, textile waste, exploitative labor—fast fashion externalizes its costs onto the planet and people who can least afford them.

### Building a Conscious Wardrobe

1. **Quality over quantity:** Invest in pieces that last
2. **Secondhand first:** Vintage and thrift are sustainable and unique
3. **Know your materials:** Natural fibers, ethical production
4. **Care for your clothes:** Proper maintenance extends life

Fashion should express who you are—including your values.
