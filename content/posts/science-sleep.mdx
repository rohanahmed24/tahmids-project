We spend a third of our lives asleep, yet most of us don't understand why. Sleep isn't passive rest—it's active maintenance, emotional processing, and memory consolidation.

## The Architecture of Sleep

Sleep isn't a single state. We cycle through **stages** multiple times each night, each serving a different purpose:
- Light sleep prepares the body
- Deep sleep repairs and regenerates
- REM sleep processes emotions and memories

> "Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day." — Matthew Walker

### Designing Better Sleep

- **Consistency:** Same time, every day—even weekends
- **Temperature:** Keep it cool (65-68°F is optimal)
- **Darkness:** Even small lights disrupt melatonin
- **Wind-down ritual:** Signal to your brain that sleep is coming

Your best ideas aren't born at your desk—they're born in your dreams.
