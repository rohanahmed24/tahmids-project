As AI systems become more powerful, the ethical questions surrounding them become more urgent. Who is responsible when an algorithm makes a harmful decision? How do we ensure fairness in systems we don't fully understand?

## The Accountability Gap

When a self-driving car causes an accident, who is at fault? The programmer? The company? The owner? This **accountability gap** is one of the defining challenges of our technological era.

> "With great power comes great responsibility—but in AI, that responsibility is distributed across thousands of decisions made by hundreds of people."

### Building Ethical AI

The path forward requires:
1. **Transparency:** Making AI decisions explainable
2. **Diversity:** Including diverse perspectives in development teams
3. **Governance:** Creating regulatory frameworks that evolve with technology
4. **Accountability:** Establishing clear chains of responsibility

The future of AI isn't just about what it can do—it's about what it *should* do.
