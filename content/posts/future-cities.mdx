The cities of 2050 will look nothing like those of today. Vertical farms will feed millions, autonomous vehicles will eliminate traffic, and buildings will generate more energy than they consume.

## The Sustainable Metropolis

Urban planners are already designing **net-zero cities**—urban environments that produce as much renewable energy as they consume. Singapore, Copenhagen, and Masdar City are leading the way.

> "The city of the future isn't just smart—it's alive, breathing, and healing itself."

### Key Innovations

- **Vertical Gardens:** Every building becomes a forest
- **Underground Networks:** Logistics move beneath our feet
- **Air Purification:** Architecture that cleans the atmosphere
- **Water Recycling:** Closed-loop systems eliminate waste

The question isn't whether we can build these cities—it's whether we have the will to transform what already exists.
