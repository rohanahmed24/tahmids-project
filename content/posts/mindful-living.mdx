In an age of constant distraction, mindfulness has become not just a practice, but a survival skill. Learning to be present transforms not just our mental health, but our entire relationship with time.

## Beyond Meditation

Mindfulness isn't about sitting cross-legged for hours. It's about **intentional attention**—bringing awareness to the mundane moments that make up our lives.

> "The present moment is the only moment available to us, and it is the door to all moments." — Thich Nhat Hanh

### Daily Practices

1. **Morning Pages:** Write three pages before checking your phone
2. **Mindful Eating:** Taste every bite without screens
3. **Walking Meditation:** Turn commutes into contemplation
4. **Digital Sunsets:** End screen time an hour before sleep

The goal isn't to escape reality—it's to finally arrive in it.
