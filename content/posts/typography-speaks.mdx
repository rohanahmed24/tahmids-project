Typography is the voice of design. Before anyone reads your words, they feel them through the shapes of your letters. Choosing the right typeface is choosing how to be heard.

## The Psychology of Fonts

Different typefaces evoke different emotions. **Serif fonts** feel traditional and trustworthy. **Sans-serif** feels modern and clean. **Script** feels personal and elegant.

> "Typography is two-dimensional architecture, based on experience and imagination, and guided by rules and readability."

### The Designer's Toolkit

1. **Hierarchy:** Guide the eye with size and weight
2. **Contrast:** Pair fonts that complement, not compete
3. **Whitespace:** Let letters breathe
4. **Rhythm:** Create visual music with consistent spacing

Great typography doesn't shout—it whispers directly into the reader's mind.
