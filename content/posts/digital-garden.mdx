Stop building archives; start planting gardens. The metaphor we use for our notes matters. An archive is where ideas go to die. A garden is where they grow.

## The Gardener's Mindset
A digital garden is a collection of notes, links, and ideas that are cultivated over time.
1.  **Seeds:** Rough ideas, unfinished thoughts.
2.  **Saplings:** Developing concepts, needing more research.
3.  **Evergreens:** Polished, timeless pieces of writing.

By tending to your digital garden daily, you create a personal internet of ideas that serves you, rather than just consuming the public one.
