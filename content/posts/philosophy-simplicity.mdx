In a world of excess, simplicity is radical. Minimalism isn't about having less—it's about making room for more of what matters.

## The Burden of Abundance

We own more than any generation in history, yet studies show we're not happier. The **paradox of choice** paralyzes us. The maintenance of stuff consumes us.

### A Minimalist Framework

1. **Question every purchase:** Does this add value to my life?
2. **Adopt the one-in-one-out rule:** For every new item, remove an old one
3. **Digitize where possible:** Reduce physical clutter
4. **Value experiences over possessions:** Memories outlast objects

The goal isn't an empty house—it's a full life.
